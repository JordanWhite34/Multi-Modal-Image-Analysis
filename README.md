# Multi-Modal-Image-Analysis

This project focuses on various image analysis tasks, including image classification, long-tailed recognition, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The goal is to develop robust models and techniques to tackle real-world challenges in computer vision.

## Problem 1: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification
We build a CNN model using the CIFAR-10 dataset to accurately classify images into ten different categories. The model leverages deep learning techniques, including convolutional layers and fully connected layers. By optimizing the model architecture and parameters, we aim to achieve high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set.

## Problem 2: Long-Tailed Recognition with Imbalanced Data
In this task, we address the challenge of imbalanced datasets and long-tailed recognition. We work with the CIFAR-100 dataset, constructing an imbalanced version (CIFAR-30) with varying class distributions. We explore resampling and reweighting techniques to improve model performance on tail classes, and compare the results with the balanced CIFAR-30 dataset.

## Problem 3: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Generation
The project includes implementing a GAN using the CelebA dataset to generate new celebrity faces. We employ deep learning techniques to train a generator and discriminator network in an adversarial setup. The GAN model learns to generate realistic and diverse facial images, demonstrating the potential of GANs in image synthesis.

This repository showcases our approaches, implementations, and results for each problem. It provides detailed code, instructions, and visualizations to reproduce our experiments. The project aims to explore advanced techniques in image analysis, promote understanding of convolutional neural networks, handle imbalanced data scenarios, and delve into the exciting field of generative adversarial networks.
